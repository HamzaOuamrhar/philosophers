-initialize all philos data (id, number of meals...)

-unlink all semaphores, open them: semaphore for forks with number of forks

-start the simulation

-for every philo: 
set l_m_t, forking, simulate with the child process only

-and for every child process:
unlink a semaphore then create it
create a thread and detach it(check for dead)
go inside the simulation loop
protect if 2 filos are eating in the same time

-kill all philos, close the semaphores
